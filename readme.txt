Fast syntax highlighter written in Javascript.

== Description ==

There are other good syntax highlighter plugins, but I wanted something simple and fast and
be able to add the highlight classes with a select box in the TinyMCE editor.

I added some default languages: Javascript, PHP, Python, C, C#, VB.NET, SQL and CSS but you can
easily add other ones.
