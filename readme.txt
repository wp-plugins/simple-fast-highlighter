Fast syntax highlighter written in Javascript.

== Description ==

There are other good syntax highlighter plugins, but I wanted something simple and fast and
be able to add the highlight classes with a select box in the TinyMCE editor.

I added some default languages: Javascript, PHP, Python, C, C#, VB.NET, SQL and CSS but you can
easily add other ones.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Usage =

1. Select the code inside a PRE tag.
2. Select the _Code_ item in the select box, this will surround the selected area with a CODE tag.
3. Then select the language, like Javascript or PHP.

Look for an example at my own site: http://www.michielvaneerd.nl
